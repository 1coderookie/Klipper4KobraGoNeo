# A config file for using a RaspberryPi Pico with *two* ADXL345 motion sensors attached to it for input shaping.

[output_pin power_mode] #-> untested, but it's supposed to force the Pico's power source to go into high-performance mode rather than power saving mode as it seems that the 3.3V line of the Pico is pretty noisy which leads to higher noise values on the ADXL measurements as well.
