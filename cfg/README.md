***USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!***
  
*Thanks to @[cringegnere](https://github.com/cringegnere) for offering his `printer.cfg` for the Neo here!*
*Thanks to @[xpeng121](https://www.reddit.com/user/xpeng121/) and @[codeneobee](https://github.com/codeneobee/) for offering their `printer.cfg` files (links below)!*  

Choose the `printer.cfg` file for your specific model (Go or Neo) from the cfg folder here, download and rename it to `printer.cfg`.  

If you don't find the belonging file for your model in the "cfg" folder here or you want to use different files, see the following links of other users who offer their `printer.cfg`:
- **GO**  
  - Reddit user [xpeng121](https://www.reddit.com/user/xpeng121/) offers his `printer.cfg` for the Go here: https://pastebin.com/xDF8ChXY
- **NEO**
  - @[codeneobee](https://github.com/codeneobee/) offers his `printer.cfg` for the Neo here: https://github.com/codeneobee/kobra-neo-klipper-config


If you want, also download the other `.cfg` files (besides the specific `printer.cfg` for your model) and take them as a start for your own settings.  

Copy the `.cfg` files to the home directory of the host where Mainsail/Fluidd/OctoPrint is running on (e.g. on a RaspberryPi it's `/home/pi/`).  
If you're using Mainsail/Fluidd, you can just upload them using the webinterface, if you're using OctoPrint you probably have to SSH into the host.

See the [main readme file](../README.md) and/or read the chapter [Klipper (Mod)](https://1coderookie.github.io/KobraGoNeoInsights/firmware/fw_klipper/) of my comprehensive infopage about the Kobra Go and Neo: ["KobraGoNeo Insights"](https://1coderookie.github.io/KobraGoNeoInsights/).

**DON'T start trying to print right away!**  
**You have to adjust the settings in the `printer.cfg` file to your system and needs and proceed with the basic config checks mentioned in the official documentation of Klipper: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html**
