***USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!***

Choose the `printer.cfg` file for your specific model (Go or Neo) and download it.  
If you want, also download the other `.cfg` files (besides the specific `printer.cfg` for your model) and take them as a start for your own settings.  

Copy the `.cfg` files to the home directory of the host where Mainsail/Fluidd/OctoPrint is running on (e.g. on a RaspberryPi it's `/home/pi/`).  
If you're using Mainsail/Fluidd, you can just upload them using the webinterface, if you're using OctoPrint you probably have to SSH into the host.

See the [main readme file](../README.md) and/or read the chapter [Klipper (Mod)](https://1coderookie.github.io/KobraGoNeoInsights/firmware/fw_klipper/) of my comprehensive infopage about the Kobra Go and Neo: ["KobraGoNeo Insights"](https://1coderookie.github.io/KobraGoNeoInsights/).

**DON'T start trying to print right away!**  
**You have to adjust the settings in the `printer.cfg` file to your system and needs and proceed with the basic config checks mentioned in the official documentation of Klipper: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html**
