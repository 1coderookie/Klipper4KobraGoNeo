**Thanks to @[jokubasver](https://github.com/jokubasver) for making the already compiled `klipper.bin` file available!**

***USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!***

Rename the file `klipper.bin` to `firmware.bin` after downloading it.  

See the [main readme file](../README.md) and/or read the chapter [Klipper (Mod)](https://1coderookie.github.io/KobraGoNeoInsights/firmware/fw_klipper/) of my comprehensive infopage about the Kobra Go and Neo: ["KobraGoNeo Insights"](https://1coderookie.github.io/KobraGoNeoInsights/) for further instructions.

**DON'T start trying to print right away!**  
**You have to adjust the settings in the `printer.cfg` file and proceed with the basic config checks mentioned in the official documentation of Klipper: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html**
